# Agentic Newsletter Generator

Multi-agent Java system that generates monthly technology newsletters using real-time data and intelligent content curation

This project creates an intelligent newsletter generation system using multiple specialized AI agents that work together to produce monthly technology newsletters. Built in Java using Quarkus, LangChain4j 1.5.0, LangChain4j Agentic for agent orchestration, MCP servers and Azure AI Foundry with various language models, this agentic application automatically gathers GitHub statistics (stars, forks, releases), analyzes community engagement, summarizes release notes, curates code examples, and compiles everything into a newsletter ready for email distribution. Each agent has a specific role - data collection, content analysis, writing, and formatting - creating a scalable solution for technology companies, developer communities, and tech enthusiasts who want to stay informed about specific technologies without manual research.

### Code Sample Agent

Generates one snippet of Java code that demonstrates the latest features and best practices of LangChain4j being covered in the newsletter. This agent analyzes recent releases and documentation to create practical, working code samples.

### References Agent

Gathers and curates comprehensive reference documentation, tutorials, and helpful resources related to LangChain4j. This agent identifies the most valuable learning materials, official documentation links, and community resources for newsletter readers.

### Releases Agent

Analyzes and summarizes recent software releases, including version updates, new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes. This agent processes release notes and changelog information to provide clear, digestible summaries of what's new.

### Statistics Agent

Collects and analyzes GitHub statistics such as star counts, fork numbers, contributor activity, issue resolution rates, and community engagement metrics. This agent provides quantitative insights into project health and growth trends.

### Newsletter Editor Agent

Compiles and formats all content from the specialized agents into a cohesive, well-structured newsletter. This agent takes the raw output from statistics, releases, references, and code sample agents and creates the final newsletter with proper formatting, flow, and editorial polish ready for distribution.

## Infrastructure

This project is designed to run on Azure AI Foundry with automated infrastructure deployment scripts.

### Azure AI Foundry Setup

The system uses Azure AI Foundry for hosting AI models with individual model deployments for each agent:

- **Agent Statistics Writer**: Collects GitHub repository metrics
- **Agent Releases Writer**: Analyzes software release information
- **Agent References Writer**: Curates documentation and resources
- **Agent Code Sample Writer**: Generates practical code examples
- **Agent Newsletter Editor**: Compiles and formats the final newsletter
- **Newsletter Workflow**: Orchestrates all agents to produce the final newsletter

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy all Azure resources
./infrastructure/create-azure-ai-foundry-resources.sh

# Clean up resources when done
./infrastructure/delete-azure-ai-foundry-resources.sh
```

The deployment creates:
- Azure Resource Group (`rg-hack2025agenticnews{username}`)
- Azure AI Foundry service with multiple model deployments
- Individual model instances for each specialized agent:
  - Phi-4 models for statistics, references, code sample, and newsletter editor agents
  - gpt-5-mini model for the releases agent
- Required environment variables for service connectivity

### GitHub Integration

Uses [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) via Model Context Protocol for:
- Repository statistics and metrics collection
- Release notes and changelog access  
- Documentation and code sample extraction
- Community engagement analysis

# Example of a Newsletter generated by the system

## LangChain4j Newsletter – May 2025

This newsletter helps you stay tuned for the latest features of LangChain4j

### What is LangChain4j?
[LangChain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/) is an open-source library that simplifies the integration of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into Java applications. It provides a unified API for interacting with various model providers and embedding stores, along with tools for prompt templating, memory management, and high-level patterns like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

#### Some Numbers

* [LangChain4j main GitHub repository](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j):

Here's how to use the new 1.0.0 ChatModel API to access a DeepSeek model deployed locally on [Foundry Local](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local) using the Azure OpenAI API:

```java
ChatModel model = OpenAiChatModel.builder()
.baseUrl("http://localhost:5273/v1")
.modelName("deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-14b-generic-gpu")
.build();

String answer = model.chat("What is the best Pink Floyd album?");
System.out.println(answer);
```
